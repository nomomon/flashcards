 * Builds the manifest object from the authored files.

 *
 * Every field here has to earn its place: the manifest exists so the overview
 * grid can render without fetching a single bank, so a field belongs only if the
 * grid needs it before a deck is loaded. `wordCount` qualifies (the grid shows a
 * count and a progress percentage per deck); a denormalized `tags` list did not,
 * an aggregate top-level revision had no consumer at all, and a `bank` path was
 * just the id spelled twice.
