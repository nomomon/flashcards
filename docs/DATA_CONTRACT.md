# Data contract (schema 2)

Everything the frontend renders comes from static files under `data/`, published
alongside the site. This file is the single source of truth for their shape. The
frontend, the validator and the audio generator all encode this contract, so a
change here is a change in three places.

## The split that matters

There are two kinds of file here, and conflating them was the main flaw in
schema 1:

- **Authored** — what a human or an AI edits. `library.json` and the `.tsv` word
  banks. Nothing in them is derived, so nothing in them can go stale.
- **Generated** — what the app consumes. `manifest.json` and `audio/index.json`,
  both produced by `tools/`. Committed (the site serves them statically) but
  never hand-edited.

Schema 1 duplicated `wordCount` and `tags` between the manifest and the deck
file, and needed a validator rule to police the duplication. Now they are derived
and the duplication cannot drift.

```
data/
├── library.json             # AUTHORED  deck metadata, the single source
├── banks/
│   └── <deckId>.tsv         # AUTHORED  one word per line
├── manifest.json            # GENERATED library + banks, with derived fields
└── audio/
    ├── index.json           # GENERATED spoken-text -> clip lookup
    └── <locale>/<sha1>.ogg  # Opus-in-Ogg, mono, speech-tuned bitrate
```

`data/` is copied to `dist/data` at build time (`frontend/scripts/postbuild.mjs`),
so in production these live at `https://flashcards.nomomon.xyz/data/...` and in
dev at `http://localhost:3000/data/...`. The frontend resolves the base from
`import.meta.env.VITE_DATA_BASE_URL`, defaulting to `/data`.

## `library.json` (authored)

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "decks": [
    {
      "id": "dutch-1",
      "name": "Dutch",
      "color": "#FF4F00",
      "icon": "languages",
      "languages": {
        "front": { "label": "Dutch", "locale": "nl-NL" },
        "back": { "label": "English", "locale": "en-US" }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- `id` — must equal the bank's filename stem.
- `color` — `#RRGGBB`.
- `icon` — **optional.** A name from the frontend's curated icon set
  (`frontend/src/features/decks/deck-icon.tsx`), shown on the deck tile. The set
  of valid names lives in the frontend and is deliberately **not** enforced here:
  an unrecognized name renders the fallback icon, so a typo costs a deck its icon
  rather than failing validation or breaking a tile. Omit it to get the default.
- `locale` — BCP-47. Drives text-to-speech voice selection, so it must be real.

No `revision`, no `wordCount`, no `tags`: all three are derived.

There is also no `bank` path field. A deck's words live at `banks/<id>.tsv`,
derived from `id` wherever the path is needed. An explicit field pinned to that
exact value carried no information and could only ever be wrong.

## `banks/<deckId>.tsv` (authored)

Tab-separated, one word per line, with a header row.

```tsv
id	front	back	tags
ik	ik	I	introduction
de-man	de man	the man	introduction
alsjeblieft	alsjeblieft (a.u.b.)	please	l1,politeness
hoe-gaat-het	Hoe gaat het?	How are you?	introduction,question
```

Tabs rather than commas because commas occur constantly in this content
(`alsjeblieft (a.u.b.)`, tag lists, glosses like "well, fine") while tabs never
do. That removes quoting and escaping entirely: a line is `split("\t")`, and
there is no quoted-field mode to get wrong.

Rules:

- **Columns are addressed by header name, not position.** Reordering columns is
  allowed; unknown columns are ignored, which is what lets a future column be
  added without a schema bump.
- Required columns: `id`, `front`, `back`. Optional: `tags`.
- `tags` is comma-separated inside the one cell; empty cell means no tags.
  Whitespace around each tag is trimmed.
- **No field may contain a tab or a newline.** The validator rejects it rather
  than inventing an escape syntax.
- Blank lines and lines whose first non-space character is `#` are skipped, so a
  bank can carry comments and be grouped visually.
- **A row may omit trailing optional columns.** `ik⇥ik⇥I` is valid and means no
  tags, exactly as `ik⇥ik⇥I⇥` does. Forgetting the final tab on a word with no
  tags is the single likeliest hand-edit slip, and it is unambiguous, so it is
  accepted rather than failed.
- A row missing a **required** column is an error, and so is a row with more
  fields than the header — that is a stray tab, which means the data is not
  saying what it looks like it says.

### Word ids

`id` is **stable, unique within the bank**, and the key user progress is stored
under. Generated as a slug of `front` (lowercase, every run outside `[a-z0-9]`
collapsed to a single `-`, trimmed, empty falling back to `word`), with `-2`,
`-3`, … appended on collision.

It is slugified `front` specifically so that progress saved by the original
Firestore-backed version — which keyed progress on the raw `front` string —
remains recoverable.

**Never renumber or reassign an existing id.** That silently resets a learner's
progress on that word. Because ids are now an explicit column rather than
something derived at load time, this is visible in review, which is the point.

### Inline formatting

`front` and `back` may carry a deliberately tiny inline-markdown subset. `id`,
`tags` and every field in `library.json` are always plain text.

| Markup          | Renders as |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| `**bold**`      | `<strong>` |
| `*italic*`      | `<em>`     |
| `__underline__` | `<u>`      |

- Delimiters may nest (`**a *b* c**`) but must be balanced.
- `\*`, `\_` and `\\` are literal escapes.
- **An unbalanced or unrecognized delimiter renders as literal text, never an
  error.** Data must not be able to break a card.
- There is no HTML, no links, no code spans, no block-level anything. Markup is
  parsed into React elements and never passed to `innerHTML`, so there is no
  injection surface even though a workflow can write these files.

Because three separate implementations must agree, "it degrades gracefully" is
not a precise enough instruction. The exact behaviour, verified identical across
all three:

- Delimiters are matched as **whole tokens**, longest first (`**`, then `__`,
  then `*`), and a token never splits across a run of delimiter characters.
- **Empty emphasis is literal, and this rule is applied first.** A delimiter
  immediately followed by its own closing token has nothing to wrap, so both
  become text: `****` → `****`. This is also why `____x____` is left *entirely*
  literal — the leading `__` pairs with the `__` right after it around nothing,
  so no underline is produced anywhere on the line.
- **A leftover delimiter is literal text outside the element, not inside it.**
  `***x***` parses to the text `**` followed by `<em>x**</em>`, and strips to
  `**x**`. Note that the leading asterisks render un-italicised, since they are
  siblings of the emphasis rather than children.

| Input         | Renders as                 | Strips to  |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- |
| `**a *b* c**` | `<strong>a <em>b</em> c</strong>` | `a b c`    |
| `***x***`     | `**` + `<em>x**</em>`      | `**x**`    |
| `****`        | `****`                     | `****`     |
| `____x____`   | `____x____`                | `____x____`|
| `un**balanced`| `un**balanced`             | `un**balanced` |

There is deliberately no bold-italic shorthand. To get both, nest explicitly:
`**a *b* c**`.

**Formatting is stripped before text-to-speech, and the stripped text is what
audio is keyed on.** So italicising a word does not orphan its clip and does not
trigger regeneration. Any tool touching audio applies the same strip: remove
delimiters, resolve escapes, leave everything else alone.

## `manifest.json` (generated)

Regenerate with `pnpm data:manifest`. Fetched on every app start
(`cache: "no-store"`); it is what tells a browser its cached decks are stale.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "decks": [
    {
      "id": "dutch-1",
      "name": "Dutch",
      "color": "#FF4F00",
      "languages": {
        "front": { "label": "Dutch", "locale": "nl-NL" },
        "back": { "label": "English", "locale": "en-US" }
      },
      "wordCount": 127,
      "revision": "3ab8f10c92d4"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `revision` — first 12 hex of `sha256` of the bank file's **exact bytes**. This
  is the deck cache key: edit a bank, the hash changes, the frontend's query key
  changes, the deck refetches, the old entry is collected. Nobody has to remember
  to bump anything.
- `wordCount` — derived from the bank.
- Everything else is copied verbatim from `library.json`.

Nothing else belongs here, and two fields were removed once that test was applied
honestly. The manifest's job is to let the **overview** render without fetching a
single bank, so a field earns its place only if the grid needs it before a deck is
loaded:

- A denormalized `tags` list was dropped. The only screen that filters by tag is
  a deck's own page, which fetches that deck's bank anyway and can count tags from
  the words in hand.
- An aggregate top-level `revision` was dropped. It had no consumer: freshness is
  decided per deck, so an all-decks hash was a value nothing ever read.
- A `bank` path was dropped, for the reason given under `library.json`.

`wordCount` is derived and stays, which is not a contradiction: being derived is
not what disqualifies a field, being derived *and unneeded* is. The grid shows a
word count and a progress percentage for every deck, and recomputing those would
mean fetching every bank on the home screen — exactly what this file exists to
avoid.

**The manifest is a pure function of the authored files.** There is no
`generatedAt` and no timestamp anywhere, so regenerating without changing content
produces a byte-identical file. CI can therefore assert the committed manifest is
exactly what the current inputs produce — a check that is meaningless if the
output contains a clock.

Because invariant 6 is a **byte** comparison, the serialization is part of the
contract, not an implementation detail: every generated JSON file here is
`JSON.stringify(value, null, 2)` followed by a single trailing newline, with
object keys in the order this document lists them (and `clips` sorted by key).
Deck order in `decks[]` follows `library.json`'s authored order, which is also the
display order; only the hash input is sorted.

## `audio/index.json` (generated)

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "voices": { "nl-NL": "Kore", "en-US": "Kore" },
  "clips": {
    "nl-NL:ik": { "path": "audio/nl-NL/8f2b1c9e4a.ogg", "bytes": 3412 }
  }
}
```

- Clip key is `` `${locale}:${strippedText}` `` — formatting removed, per above.
  Shared across decks, so a word appearing in two decks is voiced once.
- Filename stem is `sha1(key)` truncated to 10 hex chars. The hash makes
  generation idempotent: a key present in `clips` with a file on disk is skipped,
  and a deleted file is regenerated.
- No timestamps, for the same reproducibility reason as the manifest.
- Audio is Opus in Ogg: mono, 24 kHz input, ~16 kbps VBR, so a few KB per word.
  (Ogg Opus always advertises 48 kHz in its header regardless; that is inherent
  to the codec, not a mis-encode.)

## Invariants the validator enforces

1. Every `library.decks[]` entry has a bank file at `banks/<id>.tsv`, and every
   file in `banks/` is claimed by exactly one entry — no orphans, no dangles.
   With the path derived from the id, this is now one rule rather than two.
2. Deck ids are unique within `library.json`.
3. Every bank has the required columns; no field contains a tab or newline; no
   row omits a required column or carries more fields than the header. Omitting
   trailing optional columns is allowed.
4. Word ids are unique within a bank and match the slug rules (a `-N` suffix on
   the correct base slug is accepted, since ids are stable and must not be
   renumbered on reorder).
5. Inline formatting in `front`/`back` parses with balanced delimiters. Unbalanced
   markup is a **warning**, not an error — it still renders as literal text, so it
   is a likely typo rather than corruption.
6. `manifest.json` is byte-identical to a fresh regeneration from `library.json`
   and the banks.
7. Every `audio/index.json` clip path exists on disk with the recorded byte size;
   every clip key's locale is used by some deck; and no clip key contains
   formatting markup (it must be stripped text).
